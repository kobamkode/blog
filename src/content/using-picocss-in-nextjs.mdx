As we know that NextJs has a seamless integration with Tailwind when we create a new app with `npx create-next-app@latest`, it will ask us to include Tailwind CSS or not in our NextJs project. How if we want to use another CSS framework like Pico instead of Tailwind?.

I prefer to use Pico when I build this NextJs static site, because I want to make this static site minimalist, and keep my JSX looks clear and simple. 

Pico use semantic HTML tags, so we don't need to write multiple classes to style the page, also they have components that use semantic HTML tags too! please check [their page](https://picocss.com/) for more awesome features!

Back to how if we want to use Pico instead of Tailwind in our NextJs app?

1. Generate new app with `npx create-next-app@latest` as usual, but say '__No__' when it asking you to include Tailwind.
2. Install Sass support for NextJs `npm install --save-dev sass`
3. Install Pico with NPM `npm install @picocss/pico`
4. Create a `global.scss` file in `app/` directory
```scss
// app/global.scss

// because we use NextJs, import Pico with
// @use "@picocss/pico/scss/pico" instead of @use "pico".
// https://picocss.com/docs/sass#import
@use "@picocss/pico/scss/pico"
````
5. Import your `global.css` to your `app/layout.tsx`.
```tsx
// app/layout.tsx

import type { Metadata } from "next";
import "./global.scss";
```

6. Voila! restart your server, and Pico should already be applied.

If you want to customize the default styles, you can write it into `global.scss`. Here's my `global.scss` to add theme and turn-off unused Pico modules.

```scss
// app/global.scss

@use "@picocss/pico/scss/pico" with (
$theme-color: "slate",
$modules: (
	"content/code": true,
	"forms/input-color": false,
	"forms/input-date": false,
	"forms/input-file": false,
	"forms/input-range": false,
	"forms/input-search": false,
	"components/accordion": false,
	"components/card": false,
	"components/dropdown": false,
	"components/loading": false,
	"components/modal": false,
	"components/nav": true,
	"components/progress": false,
	"components/tooltip": false,
	"utilities/accessibility": false,
	"utilities/reduce-motion": false
	)
);
```

### Conclusion

Tailwind is good! I prefer to use Tailwind if I need to make a things that needs granular adjustments without writing vanilla CSS, but for this static site, I'm happy to make it minimalist with the default Pico CSS style. I wish someone could combine Pico + Tailwind so we could get the benefits of those two.
